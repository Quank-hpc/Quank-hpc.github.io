# My Projects

This header shows info about projects which I am/was developing during long-term career.
<br/>
Self-supporting project may also be metioned at here.

## FEM3He

> FEM3He focuses on developing scalable finite element method (FEM) based kit of nonlinear solvers for Ginzburg-Landau (GL) PDEs system, which generally have 18 real-valued function unknowns for superfluid He-3
> model. In general catagory, GL PDEs problems contain staionary equations i.e., saddle point equations and time-dependent equations i.e., TDGL. 
>
> Sovling the formal one provides stable(or metastable) configurations and information related to system's free energies. These knowleges are significant to investigate different possible phase transitions and different topological defects configuration.
>
> While solving the later problem help us to understand the different dynamic properties of Helium condensates such as collective modes and hydrodynamics. Moreover, Solving TDGL could reveal the dynamic process of phase tansition when the parameters of system get close to system's sanddle points.

## He3Sim

> Lattice QCD library _hila_ based dynamic solver of TDGL for superlfuid Helium. This is a join project.
>
> As a library with many generations of iterations, _hila_ is good at about simulating dynamic equations of motion of complicated fields with an uniform mesh and it is scaling well on memory distributed hardware.
>
> Combining FEM3HE and He3Sim, one may expect very dood understanding of complicated superfluid system.

## SCC-GL

> c++ and pyhton interfaces for strong coupling corrected coefficients of Ginzburg-Landau free energy. 

## Nexus-Soliton (NS)

> The NS project was started five years ago during my PhD time. The outputs have generated two major publications for 2D system. One of them is published on Nature Communication.
> When two continuous symmetry breaking phase transitions happen consecutively in superfluid system, there is a chance that new phase is made out by fribration of vacua of the first and the second phase transitions.
> This results in composite defects described by relative homotopy groups. Moreoever, the isomorphic relationship of these relative homotopy make composite objects even more compilcate --- they form nexus.
> 1D nexus has been observed expermentally, with a very good coincidence with NS simulations.

# Free time

I have few hobbies which I am really good at. They are paintings (oil and pastel En plein air), coding-hacking, and amateur radio astronomy.
