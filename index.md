**Great you checkout my page! I appreciate so much. (:**

**I am Quank(g), a postdoc research fellow with PhD degree of mathematical physics of University of Helsinki. Plz checkout my Github profile.**

**This page is the palce I show my projects and post blogs.** 

# My Projects

This header shows info about projects I am developing during career. Self-supporting prjoject may also be metioned at here.

## FEM3He

> FEM3He focuses on developing a finite element method (FEM) based kit of nonlinear solvers for Ginzburg-Landau (GL) PDEs system, which generally have 18 real-valued function unknowns. 
> In general catagory, GL PDEs contain staionary equations i.e., saddle point equations and time-dependent equations i.e., TDGL. Sovling the formal provides stable phases, stable configuraions and 
> critical configurations. While solving the later help up to understand the different dynamic properties of Helium condensates such as collective modes and hydrodynamics.

## Nexus-Soliton (NS)

> The NS project was started five years ago during my PhD time. The outputs have generated two major publications for 2D system. One of them is published on Nature Communication.
> When two continuous symmetry breaking phase transitions happen consecutively in superfluid system, there is a chance that new phase is made out by fribration of vacua of the first and the second phase transitions.
> This results in composite defects described by relative homotopy groups. Moreoever, the isomorphic relationship of these relative homotopy make composite objects even more compilcate --- they form nexus.
> 1D nexus has been observed expermentally, with a very good coincidence with NS simulations.

# Blogs

This header is the thchnical blogs post list. Covered topics will be
* HPC-related like complation, parallelism, shell script, cmake etc.;
* Language-related like modern C++, rust, html;
* tools-related and libraries-related.

# Free time

I have few hobbies which I am really good at. They are paintings (oil and pastel), coding-hacking, and amateur radio astronomy.
